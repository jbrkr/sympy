# sympy
Deeper tredging for stats Python Library. High abstraction stats/probability similar to R but with fewer package handling headaches. Made examples for probability, common probability distributions, and some plotting. Prints actual equations which is really nice. Seems to play well with Octave/MATLAB which seems like it'll be nice when documentation/classes call for it.
